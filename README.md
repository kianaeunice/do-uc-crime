## Abstract
This repository includes the contents of my individual project for DIGHUM101: Practicing the Digital Humanities (Summer 2021), where I analyzed the different crimes reported by the FBI in their Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) publications from the years of 2014 to 2019. Specifically, I looked at crimes from two categories: violent crimes (i.e. Murder/Manslaughter, Rape, Robbery, and Aggravated Assault) and property crimes (i.e. Burglary, Larceny-theft, Mother Vehicle Theft, and Arson) by year (2014 - 2019).

By cleaning the original datasets, the "most violent" campuses are UC Berkeley (2014), UC Irvine (2015), UCLA (2016), UCLA (2017), UC Berkeley (2018), and UC Davis (2019), where each campus totaled the highest in violent and property crimes. The "safest campus" in the time span of 2014 to 2019 is UC Merced by a landslide, having totals ranging from 30 to 100 total crime, which is lower than the lowest amount of totals in the other University of California campuses. Although, it is incredibly important to remember that there could be many factors towards what causes a spike or decrease of crimes in either category or in total. Maybe there could be more crime in the city the campus is located in or there could be a historical event that contributed to crime. Also, there could be a lot more crimes that go unreported, meaning that these totals might not be the actual totals at all. 

## Overall Experience
Overall, I really enjoyed looking over crime statistics. As a crime junkie, I really enjoyed learning about different crimes, whether it be intense stories and background of those individual crimes or just looking at them as numbers to represent a certain setting. I would love to dive in and create more changes and updates to this project, and extend to look at the surrounding city and its crime statistics.
