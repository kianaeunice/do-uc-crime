This repository includes the contents of my individual project for DIGHUM101: Practicing the Digital Humanities (Summer 2021), where I analyzed the different crimes reported by the FBI in their Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) publications from the years of 2014 to 2019. Specifically, I looked at crimes from two categories: violent crimes (i.e. Murder/Manslaughter, Rape, Robbery, and Aggravated Assault) and property crimes (i.e. Burglary, Larceny-theft, Mother Vehicle Theft, and Arson) by year (2014 - 2019).
